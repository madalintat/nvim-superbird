# START HERE - Nothing Works? Fix Everything Now!

## üö® Current Problem

Nothing is working because Neovim has **old cached data** from before we fixed the config.

## ‚úÖ The Fix (5 Minutes)

Follow these steps **exactly**. Copy and paste each command.

---

## Step 1: Close ALL Neovim Instances

Make sure NO Neovim is running:

```bash
# Kill all nvim processes
pkill nvim

# Verify nothing is running
ps aux | grep nvim
# Should show nothing (or just the grep command)
```

---

## Step 2: Clean Everything

Copy and paste these commands **one by one**:

```bash
# Remove plugin directory
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy

# Remove state files
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim

# Remove cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim

# Remove Mason (language servers)
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/mason

# Verify everything is gone
ls ~/.local/share/nvim/
# Should show: empty or just 'site' folder
```

---

## Step 3: First Launch (Will Take 2-5 Minutes)

```bash
cd ~/nvim-superbird
nvim
```

**What you'll see:**

1. **Lazy.nvim window appears** - Installing plugins
   ```
   lazy.nvim
   Installing...
   [====] 50/50
   ```

2. **Wait until you see "Done!" or all plugins show ‚úì**
   - Don't close Neovim!
   - Don't press anything!
   - Just wait...

3. **You might see:** `COQ deps installing...`
   - This is normal!
   - Wait for it to finish

4. **Look for errors:**
   - If you see "tsserver" error ‚Üí **IGNORE IT** (will fix on restart)
   - If you see "mason-lspconfig" error ‚Üí **IGNORE IT** (will fix on restart)
   - If you see "COQ" error ‚Üí **IGNORE IT** (will fix on restart)

---

## Step 4: Close Neovim

After everything is installed (you see "Done!" or all ‚úì):

```vim
:qa!
```

Press Enter.

---

## Step 5: Restart Neovim

```bash
nvim
```

**What should happen:**
- NO errors
- Opens normally
- Status line appears at bottom
- Everything is quiet

**If you still see errors:**
- Close again: `:qa!`
- Open again: `nvim`
- Sometimes takes 2-3 restarts for everything to settle

---

## Step 6: Verify Everything Works

### Test 1: Check Plugins

```vim
:Lazy
```

**Expected:**
- Window appears
- All plugins show green ‚úì
- No X marks or errors

Press `q` to close.

### Test 2: Check Language Servers

```vim
:Mason
```

**Expected:**
- Window appears
- Shows list of servers
- You should see: `ts_ls`, `lua_ls`, `pyright`

Press `q` to close.

### Test 3: Check Completions

```vim
:e test.lua
```

Press `i` to enter insert mode, then type:
```lua
vim.
```

**Expected:**
- Popup appears showing completions
- Shows: `vim.api`, `vim.fn`, `vim.lsp`, etc.

Press `<Esc>` then `:q!` to close.

### Test 4: Check LSP

```vim
:e test.lua
```

Press `i` and type:
```lua
local function hello()
  print("test")
end
```

Press `<Esc>`, then type `:LspInfo`

**Expected:**
- Shows "Client: lua_ls attached"
- No errors

Type `:q` to close.

---

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

If you can do all these without errors, **you're done!**

- [ ] `:Lazy` shows all ‚úì
- [ ] `:Mason` shows servers installed
- [ ] Typing shows completions
- [ ] `:LspInfo` shows lua_ls attached
- [ ] No error messages on startup

---

## üö® Still Seeing Errors?

### Error: "tsserver is not a valid entry"

**Cause:** You didn't clean properly or Neovim is still running somewhere.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Force kill everything
pkill -9 nvim

# Clean again
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.cache/nvim

# Start fresh
nvim
# Wait for install
# :qa!
# nvim again
```

### Error: "mason-lspconfig not found"

**Cause:** Plugins didn't load in correct order.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Just restart Neovim 2-3 times
nvim
:qa!
nvim
:qa!
nvim
```

### Error: "Not an editor command: COQnow"

**Cause:** COQ isn't loaded yet, or you're using wrong command.

**Fix:**
- Don't use `:COQnow` - use `:COQstatus` instead
- Or just test by typing - completions should appear automatically
- If no completions, restart Neovim

### Error: "Not an editor command: LspInfo"

**Cause:** LSP only loads when you open a code file.

**Fix:**
```vim
:e test.lua
# Type some lua code
:LspInfo
# Should work now
```

## üéØ Quick Test Script

Want to test everything at once? Run this:

```bash
# Clean install
pkill nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.cache/nvim
nvim +Lazy +qall
sleep 5
nvim +qall

# Now open and test
nvim
```

In Neovim:
```vim
:Lazy      " Should show all ‚úì
:Mason     " Should show servers
:e test.lua
```

Type in insert mode:
```lua
vim.
```

Should see completions!

## üì± If NOTHING Works

If you've tried everything and it's still broken:

### Nuclear Option - Complete Reinstall

```bash
# 1. Backup current config
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup.old

# 2. Copy fresh config
cp -r ~/nvim-superbird ~/.config/nvim

# 3. Clean everything
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/mason

# 4. Start Neovim
nvim

# 5. Wait for install (2-5 minutes)

# 6. Close and restart
:qa!
nvim
```

---

## üéì After Everything Works

Once you can do all the tests above without errors:

1. **Read:** [FIRST_THINGS_TO_TRY.md](FIRST_THINGS_TO_TRY.md)
2. **Try:** Each plugin one by one
3. **Practice:** The essential keybindings

---

## üÜò Debug Info

If you need to ask for help, run these and share the output:

```bash
# Neovim version
nvim --version

# Check config location
ls -la ~/.config/nvim/

# Check plugins
ls -la ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/ | head -20

# Check for errors in Neovim
nvim -c ':messages' -c ':qa'
```

---

## üí° What Should Work After Fix

Once everything is installed correctly:

1. **Auto-completions:**
   - Type anything, see suggestions
   - Works automatically

2. **Navigation:**
   - Press `s` + letter
   - Labels appear on screen

3. **Terminal:**
   - Press `<Space>lt`
   - Terminal opens

4. **LSP:**
   - Open any code file
   - Press `gd` on a function
   - Jumps to definition

5. **No errors:**
   - Neovim opens cleanly
   - No red error messages
   - Everything just works

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate

- **Step 1-2:** 1 minute (cleaning)
- **Step 3:** 2-5 minutes (installing)
- **Step 4-6:** 2 minutes (testing)

**Total:** 5-10 minutes max

---

## üéØ Final Check

After following all steps, this should work:

```bash
nvim test.lua
```

Press `i`, type:
```lua
vim.fn
```

**If you see completions ‚Üí SUCCESS!** ‚úÖ

**If you don't see completions ‚Üí Run the Nuclear Option above**
